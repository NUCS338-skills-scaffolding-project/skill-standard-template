# Example: Restate the Problem

> ⓘ This is the **example/template skill** that ships with the template repo.
> Replace it with your own skill once you've used it as a reference.
> See `Team-Guide.md` for the full schema and conventions.
>
> Note that this is an **instructional skill**, so it has no `logic.py` and no
> `python_entry:` field — instructional skills are pure prompt flows by default.
> See `skills/example-code/` for the code-skill pattern with `logic.py`.

## Description

Asks the student to paraphrase the prompt or problem in their own words before they start working on it. Surfaces misunderstandings of the assignment early.

## When to Trigger

- Student has just opened an assignment and starts answering immediately
- Student's first response suggests they may have misread part of the prompt
- Student asks "what is this asking?"

## Tutor Stance

- Never restate the prompt for the student
- If the student paraphrases something close, point at the specific phrase and ask what's different from the original
- Stay on the paraphrase step until the student demonstrates accurate understanding

## Flow

### Step 1 — Ask for paraphrase

Ask the student to put the prompt or problem in their own words. Be explicit that you're not looking for a solution yet.

### Step 2 — Probe the paraphrase

If anything in the paraphrase is off, point at the specific phrase and ask what the prompt actually says about it. Don't correct directly.

### Step 3 — Confirm and move on

When the paraphrase is accurate, briefly affirm and ask the student what step they'd take first.

## Safe Output Types

- Open questions
- Pointers to specific phrases in the prompt
- Brief affirmations once the paraphrase is accurate

## Must Avoid

- Restating the prompt yourself
- Giving an example paraphrase
- Moving to the solution before the paraphrase is accurate

## Example Exchange

> **Student:** "I'll just start coding the sort function."
>
> **Tutor:** "Hold on — before you start, can you tell me in your own words what the prompt is asking you to produce? What are the inputs and what's the expected output?"
